E-Commerce Backend 
This is a backend system I built for an e-commerce platform using Django and MySQL. It’s designed to handle user authentication, product management, and order processing. Basically, it’s the engine that powers an online store.

 What’s Inside  ->
#User Authentication
You can register, log in, and get access tokens (JWT).

 #Product Management
Add, update, delete, and view products.

#Order Processing
Place orders and track them.

#Secured APIs
All protected with token-based authentication.

#MySQL Database
Everything stored securely in MySQL.
